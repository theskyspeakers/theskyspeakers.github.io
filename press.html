<h1>Reviews for <a href="http://theskyspeakers.bandcamp.com/album/echo-hall" target="_new">Echo Hall</a></h1>
<p>Here's what music bloggers are saying about our debut, four-song EP, which was engineered, mixed, and mastered by our own Patrick Philips. It was released on Sept 23, 2022, and it's available on <a href="http://theskyspeakers.bandcamp.com/album/echo-hall" target="_new">Bandcamp</a>.

<p><i>Echo Hall presents us with a hard to define blend of influences, combining psych/occult rock with doom, stoner, jazz, and folk rock. The band's contrasting dual vocal offering and frequent harmonizing makes for a captivating listen. Their heavy use of saxophone is done tastefully and is complimented by the tones and textures of both synths and keyboard. Overall this is a fascinating and diverse debut and the band's future seems bright.

<p><i>Indianapolis has one of the more interesting heavy music scenes in Pethe country. There are so many good bands emerging from the region and a community that seems genuinely supportive. So much of this is captured in Echo Hall the dynamic debut from The Skyspeakers. A record that defies easy genre categorization other than 'heavy', The Skyspeakers layer male and female vocals, sludgy riffs and creative use of saxophone and synths to create something that is wholly their own. It's a unique offering quite unlike anything else going on in heavy music right now.

<p>The Ghost House<i> is the standout track and the band turn over many different levels of gloomy atmospheric rock. The song runs past the eight minutes mark and The Skyspeakers play cautiously slowly yet again but they play an exciting blend of Post-Rock and Americana sounds that does remind me of Blackwater Holylight. The lyrics have a slight GOTHIC twinge and Alternative flow that moves into heavier areas of distorted DOOM. Hell, the band even add elements of Jazz and Funk to the party and I never expected that at all.

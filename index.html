The Skyspeakers are a stoner doom and heavy psychedelic band from Indianapolis, featuring Chris Latta on bass and vocals, Jessie Browne-Michaels on alto sax and vocals, Patrick Phillips on drums, and Leah Andrews on synthesizers. 
Their sound would appeal to fans of All Them Witches, Ruby the Hatchet, Blackwater Holylight. They have shared a stage with Year of the Cobra and would fit well on bills with bands like Rezn, Faerie Ring, Howling Giant, and Lung. 
Their self-produced EP <i>Echo Hall</i> will be released Summer 2022, and they are currently booking shows in and around Indianapolis.

The Skyspeakers began incubating their first four songs in early 2019 under the name Echo Hall, with Chris Latta on bass, Jessie Browne on alto saxophone, Patrick Phillips on drums, and David Gabe on guitar. Originally envisioned as a doom band, Chris’ lyrics featured haunted loves, empty hearts, and sinister graves. He and Jessie sang them largely in unison over thundering bass and atmospheric guitar segways, with plenty of sax leads and improvised, jazz-influenced solos. They recorded a four track EP in Patrick’s home studio in 2021. However, two line-up changes left them temporarily as a three-piece with no committed guitarist.

In 2022, Leah Andrews joined on synthesizers, introducing a cosmic and otherworldly atmosphere. Their sound had shifted on the new material they were writing - Jessie had taken on the brunt of songwriting and vocals, and her lyrical themes focused around psychedelic imagery, the evolution of the Soul, and mythological themes. Realizing they didn’t want to be restricted to doom for all of their releases, they decided to rename themselves to accommodate the breadth their creative ventures might take them, and The Skyspeakers were born.

The Skyspeakers plan on remaining a heavy psychedelic four-piece, with ventures into doomgaze and post metal. Their sound would appeal to fans of All Them Witches, Ruby the Hatchet, Blackwater Holylight, and Year of the Cobra, and they would fit well on bills with bands like Rezn, Faerie Ring, Howling Giant, and Lung. The Echo Hall EP is expected to be streaming online by May 27, 2022, and The Skyspeakers are currently booking shows in and around Indianapolis for Summer and Fall 2022.
